#Description of project and used technologies
This project was created  using  frameworks: SpringMVC,SpringData JPA,Spring Security,Hibernate.
MySQL was also used as a database. Also I used JSP and JSTL 
with a combination of Css / HTML for designing pages. UI was created based on a template.
User can login as admin or simple user.Admin have possibility to add new toys,categories of toy and brands to database.
Also,admin can delete toys,categories of toy and brands from database.
Simple user have acces to his profile,where he can view toys which were bought.Only simple user can buy commodity.
As well, I have realized searching toys by name of toy and category,sorting commodities by price.
